## Corpus
### Chosen Corpus
I will be using two Spotify playlists, namely ["Best Rap Songs of 2000"](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX38t16fuNXJJ?si=4f83c993c8904728) and ["I Love My '90s Hip-Hop"](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX186v583rmzp?si=9ea41443c20e40f1). They respectively have fifty and a hundred songs in them. I chose this corpus, since I am a big fan of '90s Hip-Hop and I am curious how the Hip-Hop genre has changed in the next decade. 
### Characteristics of the Corpus
Both playlists consist of various artists and albums. They only have the genre in common: Hip-Hop. I expect Hip-Hop songs from the '90s to be more alike, as they often use samples or jazz influences in their songs. I also expect Hip-Hop songs from the 2000's to have a higher dancebility, as the Hip-Hop genre became more widely made. I am unsure if both playlists have a wide time range from their decade. 
### Representativeness of the Corpus
The corpus has more '90s songs then 2000's songs, so the 90's are more represented. Both playlists consist of a broad range of different artists from their decade, but also some songs of the same artists. This could be a limitation of the corpus. 
### Typical and Atypical Tracks
A typical track from the '90s playlist is [Do for Love by 2Pac](https://open.spotify.com/track/4AE7Lj39VnSZNOmGH2iZaq?si=d1ee18d3341a4cee). It uses a sample and from the '70s and has very meaningful lyrics. An atypical track from the '90s playlist is [Insane in the Brain by Cypress Hill](https://open.spotify.com/track/1oTHteQbmJw15rPxPVXUTv?si=330f37b1dad84b14), as it has a very different vibe then the other songs in the playlist. Idk really tbh.
